# 🚀 Bajalan Organization System API  

### 💡 Description  
As the **Backend Developer**, I designed and implemented the **database structure**, **system logic**, and **RESTful API** for the Bajalan Organization’s internal management system.  
This system enables the organization to **record, manage, and process large volumes of data** securely and efficiently.  

It also includes an **advanced text editor**, similar to Microsoft Word, for creating and formatting official documents — along with a **high-performance backend** that ensures speed, accuracy, and reliability in daily operations.
